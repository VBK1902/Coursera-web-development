	<h1>Christopher Edward Nolan</h1>
	<p onclick="alert('content from wiki');"
         >He is a British-American filmmaker known for making personal, distinctive films within the Hollywood mainstream. His directorial efforts have grossed more than US$4.7 billion worldwide and garnered a total of 34 Oscar nominations and ten wins. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential filmmakers of his generation.

Born and raised in London, Nolan developed an interest in filmmaking from a young age. After studying English literature at University College London, he made his feature debut with Following (1998). Nolan gained international recognition with his second film, Memento (2000), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He transitioned from independent to studio filmmaking with Insomnia (2002), and found further critical and commercial success with The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005–2012), The Prestige (2006), and Inception (2010), which received eight Oscar nominations, including for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay. This was followed by Interstellar (2014) and Dunkirk (2017), the latter of which earned him Academy Award nominations for Best Picture and Best Director.

Nolan's films are typically rooted in epistemological and metaphysical themes, exploring human morality, the construction of time, and the malleable nature of memory and personal identity. His work is permeated by mathematically inspired images and concepts, unconventional narrative structures, practical special effects, experimental soundscapes, large-format film photography, and materialistic perspectives. He has co-written several of his films with his brother Jonathan, and runs the production company Syncopy Inc. with his wife Emma Thomas.
Having made some of the most influential and popular films of his time,[169][170][171][172] Nolan's work has been as "intensely embraced, analyzed and debated by ordinary film fans as by critics and film academics".[164][173] Several of his films have been regarded by critics as among the best of their respective decades,[174][175][176] and according to The Wall Street Journal, his "ability to combine box-office success with artistic ambition has given him an extraordinary amount of clout in the industry."[177] In 2016, Memento, The Dark Knight, and Inception appeared in BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century list.[178] In the following year, five of his (then nine) films featured in Empire magazine's poll of "The 100 Greatest Movies".[179] Nolan has been described as "American cinema's most experimental blockbuster auteur"[180] and a "franchise unto himself."[181]

Geoff Andrew of the British Film Institute and Sight & Sound magazine, called Nolan "a persuasively inventive storyteller", singling him out as one of the few contemporary filmmakers producing highly personal films within the Hollywood mainstream. He also pointed out that his films are as notable for their "considerable technical virtuosity and visual flair" as for their "brilliant narrative ingenuity and their unusually adult interest in complex philosophical questions".[182][183] David Bordwell observed that Nolan is "considered one of the most accomplished living filmmakers," citing his ability to turn genre movies into both art and event films, as well as his box office numbers, critical acclaim, and popularity among cinemagoers.[159][184] In 2008, film critic Philip French deemed Nolan "The first major talent to emerge this [21st] century",[185] while Forbes called him "one of the most successful and acclaimed filmmakers of our time" in 2015.[186] Film critic Mark Kermode complimented the director for bringing "the discipline and ethics of art-house independent moviemaking" to Hollywood blockbusters, calling him "living proof that you don't have to appeal to the lowest common denominator to be profitable".[187] The Observer described Nolan as a "skilful, stylish storyteller, capable of combining the spectacle of Spielberg with the intellectual intricacy of Nicolas Roeg or Alain Resnais".[188] Mark Cousins applauded the director for embracing big ideas, "Hollywood filmmakers generally shy away from ideas — but not Christopher Nolan".[189] Scott Foundas of Variety declared Nolan "the premier big-canvas storyteller of his generation",[190] while Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times called him "the great proceduralist of 21st century blockbuster filmmaking, a lover of nuts-and-bolts minutiae."[191]

The filmmaker has been praised by many of his contemporaries, and some have cited his work as influencing their own.[192][193][194] Rupert Wyatt said in an interview that he thinks of Nolan as a "trailblazer ... he is to be hugely admired as a master filmmaker, but also someone who has given others behind him a stick to beat back the naysayers who never thought a modern mass audience would be willing to embrace story and character as much as spectacle".[195] Kenneth Branagh called Nolan's approach to large-scale filmmaking "unique in modern cinema", adding "regardless of how popular his movies become, he remains an artist and an auteur. I think for that reason he has become a heroic figure for both the audience and the people working behind the camera."[196] Michael Mann complimented Nolan for his "singular vision" and called him "a complete auteur".[197] Nicolas Roeg said of Nolan, "[His] films have a magic to them ... People talk about 'commercial art' and the term is usually self-negating; Nolan works in the commercial arena and yet there's something very poetic about his work."[197] Martin Scorsese identified Nolan as a filmmaker creating "beautifully made films on a big scale",[198] and Luca Guadagnino called him "one of the ultimate auteurs."[199] Damien Chazelle said of Nolan, "This is a filmmaker who has managed, time and again, to make the most seemingly impersonal projects — superhero epics, deep-space mind-benders — feel deeply personal".[200] Olivier Assayas said he admired Nolan for "making movies that are really unlike anything else. The way I see it, he has a really authentic voice."[201] Discussing the difference between art films and big studio blockbusters, Steven Spielberg referred to Nolan's Dark Knight series as an example of both;[202] he has described Memento and Inception as "masterworks".[203] Denis Villeneuve said of Nolan, "[He] is a very impressive filmmaker, because he is able to keep his identity and create his own universe in that large scope ... To bring intellectual concepts and to bring them in that scope to the screen right now — it's very rare. Every movie that he comes out with, I have more admiration for his work."[204]</p>

	<h1>Main article: List of awards and nominations received by Christopher Nolan</h1>
<p class="vbk">Nolan was named an Honorary Fellow of UCL in 2006,[205] and conferred an honorary doctorate in literature (DLit) in 2017.[206] In 2012, he became the youngest director to receive a hand-and-footprint ceremony at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles.[207] Nolan appeared in Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2015.[208]

Nolan was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2019 New Year Honours for his services to film.[209]
Nolan next directed, wrote, and produced the science-fiction film Interstellar (2014). The first drafts of the script were written by Jonathan Nolan, and it was originally to be directed by Steven Spielberg.[113] Based on the scientific theories of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole in search of a new home for humanity.[114] Interstellar starred Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Michael Caine, and Ellen Burstyn, and was Nolan's first collaboration with cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema. Interstellar was released in November 2014 to largely positive reviews and strong box office results, grossing over $670 million worldwide.[115][116][117] A. O. Scott wrote, in his review for The New York Times, "Interstellar, full of visual dazzle, thematic ambition ... is a sweeping, futuristic adventure driven by grief, dread and regret."[118] Documentary filmmaker Toni Myers said of the film, "I loved it because it tackled the most difficult part of human exploration, which is that it's a multi-generational journey. It was a real work of art."[119] Interstellar was particularly praised for its scientific accuracy, which led to the publication of two scientific papers[120] and the American Journal of Physics calling for it to be shown in school science lessons.[121][122] It was named one of the best films of the year by The American Film Institute (AFI).[123] At the 87th Academy Awards, the film won Best Visual Effects and received four other nominations – Best Original Score, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Production Design.[124] In 2014, Nolan and Emma Thomas also served as executive producers on Transcendence (2014), the directorial debut of Nolan's longtime cinematographer Wally Pfister.[125] The film was released to mostly unfavorable reviews and disappointing box office results.[126]

In the mid-2010s, Nolan took part in several ventures for film preservation and distribution of the films of lesser-known filmmakers. His production company, Syncopy, formed a joint venture with Zeitgeist Films to release Blu-ray editions of Zeitgeist's prestige titles.[127] As part of the Blu-ray release of the animation films of the Brothers Quay, Nolan directed the documentary short Quay (2015). He also initiated a theatrical tour, showcasing the Quays' In Absentia, The Comb, and Street of Crocodiles. The program and Nolan's short received critical acclaim, with Indiewire writing in their review that the brothers "will undoubtedly have hundreds, if not thousands more fans because of Nolan, and for that The Quay Brothers in 35mm will always be one of latter's most important contributions to cinema".[128][129] An advocate for the survival of the analogue medium, Nolan and visual artist Tacita Dean invited representatives from leading American film archives, laboratories, and presenting institutions to participate in an informal summit entitled Reframing the Future of Film at the Getty Museum in March 2015.[130][131] Subsequent events were held at Tate Modern in London, Museo Tamayo in Mexico City, and Tata Theatre in Mumbai.[132] In 2015, Nolan also joined the board of directors of The Film Foundation, a US-based non-profitable organisation dedicated to film preservation,[133] and was appointed, along with Martin Scorsese, by the Library of Congress to serve on the National Film Preservation Board (NFPB) as DGA representatives.[134]

After serving as an executive producer alongside Thomas on Zack Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) and Justice League (2017), the sequels to Man of Steel,[135][136] Nolan returned to directing with Dunkirk (2017). Based on his own original screenplay and co-produced with Thomas, the story is set amid World War II and the evacuation of Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk, France, in 1940. Describing the film as a survival tale with a triptych structure, Nolan wanted to make a "sensory, almost experimental movie" with minimal dialogue.[137] He said he waited to make Dunkirk until he had earned the trust of a major studio to let him make it as a British film, but with an American budget.[138] Before filming, Nolan sought advice from Spielberg, who later said in an interview with Variety, "knowing and respecting that Chris [Nolan] is one of the world's most imaginative filmmakers, my advice to him was to leave his imagination, as I did on Ryan, in second position to the research he was doing to authentically acquit this historical drama."[139] Starring Fionn Whitehead, Jack Lowden, Aneurin Barnard, Harry Styles, Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy, and Kenneth Branagh,[140] Dunkirk was released in theatres in July 2017 to widespread critical acclaim and strong box office results.[141][142][143] It grossed over $525 million worldwide, which made it the highest-grossing World War II film of all time.[144] In his review, Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: "It's one of the best war films ever made, distinct in its look, in its approach and in the effect it has on viewers. There are movies—they are rare—that lift you out of your present circumstances and immer
